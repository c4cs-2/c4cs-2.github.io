### Description

Use asciinema to record your terminal session and share it online. Begin by typing asciinema rec in your terminal to begin recording your session. When you are done recording, type exit or 'ctrl-d'. Asciinema will then ask you what you want to do with your recording. If you press 'enter' your video will be uploaded to asciinema.org. 'ctrl-c' will save the video to your /tmp/ directory. If you choose to upload to asciinema.org, a link will appear in the terminal. If you go to it you will literally see a video of your terminal activity, including bash commands and terminal output, from the time you began recording until you exited.
